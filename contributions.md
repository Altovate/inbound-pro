# Contribute To Inbound WP

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that we can keep on top of things.

__Please Note:__ GitHub is for bug reports and contributions only - if you have a support question or a request for a customization don't post here, go to our [Support page](https://support.inboundnow.com) instead.

## Getting Started

  * __Do not report potential security vulnerabilities here. Email them privately to our security team at [hudson@inboundnow.com](mailto:hudson@inboundnow.com)__
  * Before submitting a ticket, please be sure to replicate the behavior with no other plugins active and on a base theme like Twenty Seventeen.
  * Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Raise it on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/Easy-Digital-Downloads/issues)
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce the bug and screenshots of the bug itself.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue as well as the version of WordPress you're using.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Make the changes to your forked repository
* Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards)
* When committing, reference your issue (if present) and include a note about the fix
* If possible, and if applicable, please also add/update unit tests for your changes
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'develop' branch of the inbound-pro repository

## Code Documentation

* We ensure that every EDD function is documented well and follows the standards set by phpDoc
* An example function can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/sunnyratilal/5308969)
* Please make sure that every function is documented so that when we update our API Documentation things don't go awry!
* Finally, please use spaces and not tabs.

At this point you're waiting on us to merge your pull request. We'll review all pull requests, and make suggestions and changes if necessary.
